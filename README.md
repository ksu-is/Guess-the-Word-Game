# Guess-the-Word-Game
	A word guess game where the player has 10 tries to guess a 5-7 letter word.

Description
	The program will first ask for the player’s name and welcome them to the game before describing the rules of the game. Then the program will pull a random     word from a word bank and convert it into blank spaces underlined with dashes so the player can know how many letters the word they must guess is. There      	will be a set amount of tries and the software will keep track of and print the number of attempts taken and each letter guessed along with whether the 			guess was correct or incorrect. After the number of attempts are used up, the player will either win if they’ve guessed all the letters in the word 		 		 	or they will lose if they have not.
