# Guess-the-Word-Game
A word guess game where the player has 10 tries to guess a 5-7 letter word.

# Description
The program will first ask for the player’s name and welcome them to the game before describing the rules of the game. Then the program will pull a random   word from a word bank and convert it into blank spaces underlined with dashes so the player can know how many letters the word they must guess is. There     will be a set amount of tries and the software will keep track of and print the number of attempts taken and each letter guessed along with whether the guess was correct or incorrect. After the number of attempts are used up, the player will either win if they’ve guessed all the letters in the word or they will lose if they have not.

# Getting Started
Visual Studio Code and the most recent version of Python are needed.

# Installing
Add how/where to download the program

# Executing Program
Add how to run the program

# Help
The Guess the Word game pulls a random word from a text file that can be updated and changes made to. If the game is played repeatedly the words pulled might get repetitive. If this were to happen, the text file containing the word list must be edited and expanded to include more words.
