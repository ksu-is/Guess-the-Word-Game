# TASK 1: 
First I will evaluate existing Python code bases and tutorials related to this project. These can be found in the Acknowledgements section of the README.md file. The first tutorial is by teachwithict.com and helpfully breaks down the code into step by step parts before putting it all together. It's a relatively short code with comments describing and labeling all the steps and I picked this tutorial specifically for the way it incorporates dashes as a way to represent each letter in whatever word is pulled. This tutorial also demonstrates how to program your code to pull a word from a list at random. I will attempt to use both of these elements when coding my own word guessing game. The second tutorial I found was by Educative and it suggests creating a seperate .txt file that contains a word list. Then you would read the .txt file in Python and split the lines to have your word list. This tutorial also demonstrates how to create a loop for this type of game. The last tutorial I found was from Geeksforgeeks and they chose to create a word bank within Python and have the code pull a random word from it. I'm not sure yet if I want to go the .txt file route or word bank route. 

**DONE**

# TASK 2:
Create a new Python file and start coding! First decide on whether I'm going to go the word.txt file route to pull words from or a word bank within the Python code route. Then I need to create the list of words and determine the greeting and explanation players will first see when starting my game. I need to make sure the explanation of the rules of the game is short, concise, and straightforward. Then I need to start coding, using the different tutorials I found to help me along the way. Breaking the code down into parts should help me figure it out. 

**DONE -> Note: I'm combining different elements from the different tutorials into my program in a way that suits my needs, but I may have to rework some of the code after running it since there may be errors that I have to fix.**

# Task 3:
Run the code and check for errors. If there are errors, assess and fix them. Once the code runs correctly, play the game a few times to make sure it feels cohesive and fun! 

**DONE -> Note: It took me several tries to get the code running correctly, since the way I combined the elements from the different turtorials wasn't, at first, correct. It took me several rounds of trial and error for me to figure out where to store the many variables since I had several def statements and also a loop. After I figured out that part and the code was working properly, I also edited the code to change the look of the game stylisticly, as in the spacing between lines and such.**

# Task 4:
Create a powerpoint slide pitching my project idea, including a tagline and screenshots of my code and how the game looks when played. 

**DONE**

# Task 5:
I need to make sure to update my README.md and projectroadmap.md files as I go to keep track of my progress.

**DONE**
