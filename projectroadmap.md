# TASK 1: 
First I will evaluate existing Python code bases and tutorials related to this project. These can be found in the Acknowledgements section of the README.md file. The first tutorial is by teachwithict.com and helpfully breaks down the code into step by step parts before putting it all together. It's a relatively short code with comments describing and labeling all the steps and I picked this tutorial specifically for the way it incorporates dashes as a way to represent each letter in whatever word is pulled. This tutorial also demonstrates how to program your code to pull a word from a list at random. I will attempt to use both of these elements when coding my own word guessing game. The second tutorial I found was by Educative and it suggests creating a seperate .txt file that contains a word list. Then you would read the .txt file in Python and split the lines to have your word list. This tutorial also demonstrates how to create a loop for this type of game. The last tutorial I found was from Geeksforgeeks and they chose to create a word bank within Python and have the code pull a random word from it. I'm not sure yet if I want to go the .txt file route or word bank route.
