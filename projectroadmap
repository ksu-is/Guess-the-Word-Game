 Task #1: First I will evaluate existing Python code bases and tutorials related to this project. These can be found in the Acknowledgements section of the README.md file. The first tutorial is by teachwithict.com and helpfully breaks down the code into step by step parts before putting it all together. It's a relatively short code with comments describing and labeling all the steps and I picked this tutorial specifically for the way it incorporates dashes as a way to represent each letter in whatever word is pulled. This tutorial also demonstrates how to program your code to pull a word from a list at random. I will attempt to use both of these elements when coding my own word guessing game.
